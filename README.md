Swift Analytics Framework


This framework will be an end to end approach including architecture design, TDD and development that is based on the article described in https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-an-enum-based-analytics-system-in-swift and youtube channel Essentialdeveloper.com

Besides enum based approach, the architecture will evolve to protocol oriented approach where it will be more flexiable and maintainable.
